.m file is for the smooth switching controller design and obtain the controller variables. 
.mat files give controller variables on two subregions to construct gain-scheduling controller, and used in time-domain simulation.
To solve the formulated SDP, we need Yalmip, Rolmip and sedumi/SDPT3. Please add these package foler to MATLAB path.
